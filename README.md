Welcome to the Weather App! This application provides real-time weather information for any specified location. Additionally, it can detect the user's current location using the Geolocation API and display the local weather data upon loading the website. Whether you want to know the weather for your travel destination or simply check the forecast for your current location, this app has you covered.
Also this app is mobile responsive, so you can use it freely on any device (see the following images)

Notes: 
- The reason you only see two commits is that I accidentally used a force push :), which erased all my previous commits. I was only able to restore two commits locally because I was working on a different computer. That's why there are only two commits visible now.
- When you search cities, just press enter after you type desired word or click the search icon 
- This website is mobile responsive (see the images bellow)

**Tech stack**
 - [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)  - is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages. It's a cornerstone technology used for structuring and presenting content on the web.
- [Sass (Scss)](https://sass-lang.com/)  - is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, and functions, making CSS more maintainable and easier to write.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)  - is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. It adds static types to JavaScript, which helps in catching errors early during development and improves overall code quality.

**Getting started**
 - I hosted the app using Vercel, so feel free to check it out  ðŸ‘‰[Weatherio](https://weather-rnb3wge5m-karlos-projects-42cba8bf.vercel.app/)
 - I haven't used any extra dependencies (I wanted to make things as simple as possible), so all you have to do is to clone this project if you want to run it locally 
 - `git clone "https://github.com/karloCroDev/Weatherio.git"`
